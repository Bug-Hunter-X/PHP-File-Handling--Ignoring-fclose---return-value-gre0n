```php
$file = fopen('myfile.txt', 'r');
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error
    echo 'Error opening file.';
}
```
This code has a potential issue: it doesn't explicitly check the return value of `fclose()`.  While `fclose()` usually succeeds, it's possible for it to fail (e.g., due to disk errors).  The failure might not be immediately apparent.

The lack of `fclose()` error checking can lead to resource leaks (file handles not properly closed) and potentially data corruption. Also, it doesn't provide any feedback to the user about whether the file was closed successfully.
