```php
$file = fopen('myfile.txt', 'r');
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    if (fclose($file)) {
        echo 'File closed successfully.';
    } else {
        echo 'Error closing file.';
        // Handle the error appropriately, such as logging it
    }
} else {
    // Handle the error
    echo 'Error opening file.';
}
```
The improved code explicitly checks the result of `fclose()`. If it returns `false`, it indicates an error, which can be handled appropriately (e.g., by logging the error and taking corrective actions). This robust approach prevents potential resource leaks and improves the overall reliability of the file handling process.
